            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I hail from the beautiful country of <abbr title="Vietnam">VN</abbr>, a place filled with rich culture and breathtaking landscapes. 
                Growing up in this vibrant nation has instilled in me a deep appreciation for diversity and a strong sense of community. 
                My journey in life has been greatly influenced by the values and traditions of my homeland, shaping me into the person I am today.

                One of my greatest passions is <strong>design</strong>. I have always been captivated by the world of art and aesthetics. 
                Whether it's <em>graphic design</em>, <em>interior design</em>, or <em>any form of creative expression</em>, I find joy in exploring and learning about the intricacies of design. 
                This passion has driven me to constantly seek out opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my love for design, I am a <strong>dedicated learner</strong>. I firmly believe that knowledge is a powerful tool, and I am committed to lifelong learning. 
                Whether it's discovering new design techniques or exploring different cultures, I thrive on acquiring new insights and experiences. 
                This curiosity fuels my desire to grow personally and professionally, making every day an exciting adventure in the pursuit of knowledge and creativity.
